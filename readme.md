# anime upscaler

My usage of [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) to upscale anime.

# How To Use

## Install libraries

A record is kept in requirements.txt, and can be installed with:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

However, after doing this, you must also install image slicer with:

`pip install -e submodules/image_slicer` 

And also install BasicSR with:

`pip install -e submodules/BasicSR`

## Download anime model:

https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/blob/master/docs/anime_model.md

## For a single image:

`python3 frame_esrgan.py -m /path/to/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth -i path/to/img -o path/to/img.png`

If memory usage is too high and you need to split frames and stitch back together use the `-s, --split` argument. Default number of splits is 4, but you can make as many as you want.

If you want to change the final size, one can now add the `-r` or the `--resize` argument, followed by a string indicating the desired resolution, for example we would add `-r 1920x1080` to resize the output to that size.

Please note that the output of a single image must be a PNG due to alpha channel. Will be fixed in the future hopefully

## For a video:

`python3 anime_upscaler.py -m /path/to/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth -i path/to/video -o path/to/desired/output -s -a`

If you do not want audio, remove the `-a` at the end
